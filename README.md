# MAWG

_Modulation and Arbitrary Waveform Generator for an FPGA_

My final undergraduate thesis project. The Verilog source code is accompanied by a Vivado project file and a Xilinx Design Constraint (XDC) file targeted to a Nexys4 DDR Artix-7 FPGA.

This project involves developing efficient, flexible and parameterisable cores that would be used for larger FPGA projects, specifically SDR applications such as radar, telecommunications, and cognitive radio.

## Modes of operation

The MAWG currently provides the following modes of operation:

* Generate standard waveforms at specified frequencies, including sinusoidal, sawtooth, pulse, and chirp signals.
* Modulate an arbitrary signal using frequency modulation with a specified carrier frequency and frequency deviation.

The top level driver module provides a UART interface for real-time configuration of the MAWG. The `cfg_cli.py` script implements a Python serial side of the interface.

A single signal is output at the audio jack of the Nexys4 board and at a PmodDA4 attached to the JA Pmod connector.
